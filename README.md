# Description

**Anki download ID: `546020849`**

An Anki add-on that adds "fill in the blank"-style hints to cloze cards. For
example, a cloze card with `{{c1:fill in the blanks}}` will become
`{{c1:fill in the blanks::__ _ _ ___}}`. It ignores clozes that already have
a custom hint set.

To run, select the "Add blanks to cloze notes" item under the Tools menu on the
overview screen to apply it to all cards, or from the Edit menu in the browser
to apply it only to selected cards.

# Requirements

This add-on assumes you have a "Cloze" note type.

# Support
