# Description

An Anki add-on that adds "fill in the blank"-style hints to cloze cards. For
example, a cloze card with `{{c1:fill in the blanks}}` will become
`{{c1:fill in the blanks::__ _ _ ___}`. It ignores clozes that already have
a custom hint set.

To run, select the "Add blanks to cloze notes" item under the Tools menu.

# Requirements

This add-on assumes you have a "Cloze" note type.

# Support

Post a [new issue on Github](https://github.com/Arthaey/anki-cloze-blanks/issues/new)
(or make a pull request!).

[My other Anki add-ons](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AArthaey+anki)
are also on Github.

# TODO

- automatically create cloze blanks when creating new cards
